 * @brief Protocol for opening several multi-linear polynomials at the same point.
 *
 *
 * m = number of variables
 * n = 2ᵐ
 * u = (u₀,...,uₘ₋₁)
 * f₀, …, fₖ₋₁ = multilinear polynomials,
 * g₀, …, gₕ₋₁ = shifted multilinear polynomial,
 *  Each gⱼ is the left-shift of some f↺ᵢ, and gⱼ points to the same memory location as fᵢ.
 * v₀, …, vₖ₋₁, v↺₀, …, v↺ₕ₋₁ = multilinear evalutions s.t. fⱼ(u) = vⱼ, and gⱼ(u) = f↺ⱼ(u) = v↺ⱼ
 *
 * We use a challenge ρ to create a random linear combination of all fⱼ,
 * and actually define A₀ = F + G↺, where
 *   F  = ∑ⱼ ρʲ fⱼ
 *   G  = ∑ⱼ ρᵏ⁺ʲ gⱼ,
 *   G↺ = is the shift of G
 * where fⱼ is normal, and gⱼ is shifted.
 * The evaluations are also batched, and
 *   v  = ∑ ρʲ⋅vⱼ + ∑ ρᵏ⁺ʲ⋅v↺ⱼ = F(u) + G↺(u)
 *
 * The prover then creates the folded polynomials A₀, ..., Aₘ₋₁,
 * and opens them at different points, as univariates.
 *
 * We open A₀ as univariate at r and -r.
 * Since A₀ = F + G↺, but the verifier only has commitments to the gⱼs,
 * we need to partially evaluate A₀ at both evaluation points.
 * As univariate, we have
 *  A₀(X) = F(X) + G↺(X) = F(X) + G(X)/X
 * So we define
 *  - A₀₊(X) = F(X) + G(X)/r
 *  - A₀₋(X) = F(X) − G(X)/r
 * So that A₀₊(r) = A₀(r) and A₀₋(-r) = A₀(-r).
 * The verifier is able to computed the simulated commitments to A₀₊(X) and A₀₋(X)
 * since they are linear-combinations of the commitments [fⱼ] and [gⱼ].

* @brief Compute the expected evaluation of the univariate commitment to the batched polynomial.

Initialize __eval_pos__ with batched MLE eval v = ∑ⱼ ρʲ vⱼ + ∑ⱼ ρᵏ⁺ʲ v↺ⱼ

The folding property ensures that
$$
Aₗ(r^{2ˡ}) = (1-uₗ₋₁)\frac{Aₗ₋₁(r^{2ˡ⁻¹}) + Aₗ₋₁(−r^{2ˡ⁻¹})}{2} + uₗ₋₁\frac{Aₗ₋₁(r^{2ˡ⁻¹}) - Aₗ₋₁(−r^{2ˡ⁻¹})}{2r^{2ˡ⁻¹}}
$$

We solve the above equation in Aₗ₋₁(r^{2ˡ⁻¹}), using the previously computed $Aₗ(r^{2ˡ})$ in __eval_pos__ and using $Aₗ₋₁(−r^{2ˡ⁻¹})$ sent by the prover in the proof.
